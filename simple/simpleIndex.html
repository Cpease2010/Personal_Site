  <h2>Well Litterally:</h2>

  <h3>(I'm also a new <em>pretty awesome</em> <b>Uncle!</b>)</h3>
  <h2>Why I'm Here:</h2>
  <p>I'm in this immersive for the traditional reason:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Money</li>
    <li>Flexibiliy</li>
    <li>Prestege</li>
    <li>The Challenge</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Where I'm From:</h2>
  <p>I was born bred and fed Denver, CO. I grew up in the Five Points and Park Hill area when it was cheap and kinda sketchy. I went to East High School, would be class of '09, opted for my G.E.D. when I was 15.</p>
  <h2>What I've Done for Work:</h2>
  <h3>(First to Last - ish)</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Construction Clean-Up</li>
    <li>Bus Boy</li>
    <li>Cook</li>
    <li>Forklift Operator</li>
    <li>Theather Usher</li>
    <li>Call Center Agent</li>
    <li>Waiter</li>
    <li>Pizza Delivery</li>
    <li>Uber Driver</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>How'd I End Up Here:</h2>
  <p>Well I've babble in tech more or less my whole life but mostly on a consumer to customer support basisn, no coding. I've research different options over the past couple years and I was either going to teach myself or come hear. I chose to come to Galvanzie
    to be surrounded by people I could relate to and network with, rather than sitting in my basement telling myself I'm learning to code.</p>
